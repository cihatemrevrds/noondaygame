# Complete Game Loop Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete 7-phase game loop integration with lobby-configured phase durations, unified dark western theme UI, and seamless transitions between all game phases.

## ðŸŽ¯ Completed Features

### 1. **Complete 7-Phase System Integration**
- âœ… **Phase 1: Role Reveal** - Popup-based role display with dark western theme
- âœ… **Phase 2: Night Phase** - Night actions using existing `NightPhaseScreen`
- âœ… **Phase 3: Night Outcome** - Private event popups using `NightOutcomePopup`
- âœ… **Phase 4: Event Sharing** - Public event popups using `EventSharePopup`
- âœ… **Phase 5: Discussion Phase** - New `DiscussionPhaseWidget` with improved UI
- âœ… **Phase 6: Voting Phase** - New `VotingPhaseWidget` with single-vote mechanics
- âœ… **Phase 7: Voting Outcome** - Vote result popups using `VoteResultPopup`

### 2. **Real-Time Phase Management**
- âœ… **Server-Side Timing**: Phase durations managed by Firebase backend (30s night, 10s outcomes, 5s events, 2min discussion, 30s voting)
- âœ… **Client-Side Timer**: Real-time countdown synchronization with server timestamps
- âœ… **Phase Transition Logic**: Automatic progression through all 7 phases
- âœ… **Manual Phase Control**: Host can override automatic progression when enabled

### 3. **Unified Dark Western Theme**
All popups now use consistent styling:
- **Dark Gradient Background**: `LinearGradient([Color(0xFF2B1810), Color(0xFF1A0F08)])`
- **Orange Borders**: `Colors.orange.withOpacity(0.5)` with 2px width
- **High-Contrast Shadows**: Black shadows with opacity 0.8+ for depth
- **Team-Based Colors**: Green (Citizens), Red (Bandits), Gray (Neutrals)
- **Western Typography**: Rye font family with appropriate sizing

### 4. **Enhanced Game Screen Architecture**
- âœ… **Phase-Specific Widget Builder**: `_buildPhaseWidget()` method dynamically renders appropriate UI
- âœ… **Waiting Screens**: Elegant loading states during popup phases with themed icons
- âœ… **Real-Time Updates**: Complete lobby listener integration with phase timing
- âœ… **Event Handling**: Phase-specific popup management with proper state tracking

### 5. **Improved Discussion & Voting UI**
- âœ… **Discussion Phase**: Removed "Players" title, reduced shadow intensity (opacity 0.4, blur 6)
- âœ… **Voting Phase**: 20px vote buttons, team-colored role indicators, single-vote toggle system
- âœ… **Vote Integration**: Seamless integration with existing `GameService.submitVote()`
