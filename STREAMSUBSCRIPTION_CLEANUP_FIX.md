# StreamSubscription Management Fix for XMLHttpRequest Errors

## Problem Summary
After lobby deletion, `game_screen.dart` continued to make Firebase function calls through an unmanaged StreamSubscription, causing XMLHttpRequest errors and unnecessary Firebase function invocations that impact costs.

## Root Cause
The `game_screen.dart` file was using a direct `.listen()` call without storing the StreamSubscription reference:
```dart
_lobbyService.listenToLobbyUpdates(widget.lobbyCode).listen((snapshot) => {
  // listener code
});
```

This meant the subscription could not be properly cancelled when the widget was disposed, causing continued Firebase calls even after the component was destroyed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added StreamSubscription Import
```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
```

### 2. Added StreamSubscription Variable Declaration
```dart
StreamSubscription<DocumentSnapshot<Map<String, dynamic>>>? _lobbySubscription;
```

### 3. Modified _setupLobbyListener to Store Subscription
```dart
void _setupLobbyListener() {
  print('ðŸ“¡ Connecting to lobby: ${widget.lobbyCode}');
  
  _lobbySubscription = _lobbyService.listenToLobbyUpdates(widget.lobbyCode).listen((snapshot) {
    // existing listener logic...
  });
}
```

### 4. Enhanced dispose() Method for Proper Cleanup
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
  _phaseTimer?.cancel();
  _phaseTimer = null;
  _lobbySubscription?.cancel();  // âœ… NEW: Cancel Firebase subscription
  _lobbySubscription = null;     // âœ… NEW: Clear reference
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Reference Implementation
This fix follows the same pattern successfully used in `lobby_room_page.dart`:
- StreamSubscription variable declaration
- Assignment in listener setup method
- Proper cancellation in dispose()

## Expected Results
1. **Eliminates XMLHttpRequest Errors**: No more Firebase calls after widget disposal
2. **Reduces Firebase Function Costs**: Stops unnecessary function invocations 
3. **Improves App Stability**: Prevents memory leaks and resource consumption
4. **Maintains Game Functionality**: All existing game features continue working normally

## Testing
- Unit tests added in `test/streamsubscription_cleanup_test.dart`
- Manual testing should verify no XMLHttpRequest errors in browser console after leaving game screen
- Firebase function logs should show reduced call volume after lobby deletion

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/game_screen.dart` - Added StreamSubscription management
- `test/streamsubscription_cleanup_test.dart` - Added verification tests

This fix completes the XMLHttpRequest error resolution by ensuring proper cleanup of Firebase listeners when game components are disposed.
